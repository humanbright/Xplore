# Xplore
## Inspiration
#### One of us couldn't say the word 'itinerary' if their life depended on it. 
Thus, the concept for Xplore was born: an intuitive app designed to take the complexity out of travel planning. With just a few taps, Xplore builds the perfect travel agenda, proving that even a linguistic faux pas could lead to a brilliant solution for adventurers everywhere.
## What it does
#### Xplore is the ideal partner for your travel adventures, always prepared to support you on your next journey.
As your ultimate travel companion, Xplore primarily focuses on three key functions:
1. Travelers can specify their city destinations, the duration of stay in each city, travel radius, and the types of attractions they wish to visit.
2. Users can tailor their journey using Xplore's AI-driven recommendations for attractions, with the option to manually select or opt for automatic suggestions.
3. Xplore generates and stores routes for adventurers to visit their selected attractions, enhancing their travel experience.
