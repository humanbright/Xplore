# Xplore
## Inspiration
#### Someone here can't say the word 'itinerary' if their life depended on it. 
Thus, the concept for Xplore was born, an intuitive app designed to take the complexity out of travel planning. With just a few taps, Xplore builds the perfect travel agenda, proving that even a linguistic faux pas could lead to a brilliant solution for adventurers everywhere.
## What it does
Xplore is your ultimate travel companion, designed to effortlessly craft the perfect itinerary for your next city adventure. Simply input your chosen destination, and Xplore taps into the power of the Yelp Fusion API to curate a list of top-rated attractions, ensuring you experience the best a city has to offer. To guarantee the reliability of your travel plans, each location is verified through the Melissa API, providing a seamless integration of accurate contact data and location validity. With Xplore, you're not just visiting; you're immersing yourself in the highest-rated experiences, handpicked and validated, for an unforgettable journey every time.
