# Xplore
## Inspiration
#### One of us couldn't say the word 'itinerary' if their life depended on it. 
Thus, the concept for Xplore was born: an intuitive app designed to take the complexity out of travel planning. With just a few taps, Xplore builds the perfect travel agenda, proving that even a linguistic faux pas could lead to a brilliant solution for adventurers everywhere.
## What it does
#### Xplore is your ultimate travel companion, designed to effortlessly craft the perfect itinerary for your next city adventure.
